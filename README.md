# yespower-1.0.1
yespower is a proof-of-work (PoW) focused fork of yescrypt, which in turn builds upon scrypt. While yescrypt is a password-based key derivation function (KDF) and password hashing scheme, and thus is meant for processing passwords, yespower is meant for processing trial inputs such as block headers (including nonces) in PoW-based blockchains. https://www.openwall.com/yespower/
